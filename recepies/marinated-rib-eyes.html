    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Marinating rib-eye steaks in Worcestershire sauce and brown sugar makes them tender with a hint of sweetness. Sometimes I add a little Dijon mustard and red pepper flakes for a bit of zing.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat</li>
        <li>4 (1/2 pound) rib-eye steaks</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>⅓ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for brushing grill</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season steaks with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper; set aside</li>
        <li>Place Worcestershire sauce and brown sugar into a large resealable plastic bag; seal the bag and shake to mix. Pour 1/2 of the marinade into another large resealable plastic bag. Place 2 steaks in each bag and turn to coat. Squeeze out excess air and seal the bags. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate</li>
        <li>Drain marinade from the bags into a small saucepan; bring to a boil and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Set aside</li>
        <li>Grill steaks on the preheated grill to desired doneness, about 7 minutes per side. Baste often with boiled marinade during the final 5 minutes of cook time. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of steaks should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium doneness</li>

    </ol>
